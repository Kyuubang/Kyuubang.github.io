ansible wrote in python, so we need python 2.7 or python 3.8 higher to run ansible 
properly. many given methods to install ansible, here I wanna share with you to 
setup controller node ansible with pip. 

pip is a python package manager, we use pip because is simple and we can keep it 
isolated with virtualenv. to install the latest pip type and run the following 
command.

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```

and we need virtualenv too to create an isolated environment. 

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

and let's create a virtual environment with virtualenv and activated it with the 
command below.

```bash
$ virtualenv ansible; source ~/ansible/bin/activate
```

next, we can install ansible with pip install

```bash
(ansible)$ pip install ansible
```

if virtualenv activated check ansible has been installed properly with the 
following command

```bash
(ansible)$ ansible --version
```

if no error found, congratulations you succeed in installing ansible on the 
controller node next, we can try the simple playbook and configure the Ansible 
inventory. Inventory is simply explained as a list or group of managed nodes. 
for example, we have two managed nodes called worker and master, and we can type 
like this.

```yaml
[master]
node-master ansible_host=192.168.2.2 ansible_user=ansible
[worker]
worker-1 ansible_host=192.168.2.3 ansible_user=ansible
worker-2 ansible_host=192.168.2.4 ansible_user=ansible
```

for grouping identified with sign `[nameofgroup]`. pro tips we can also define 
an ip host and default user for ssh. 

ansible run task on playbook. here an example playbook for installing docker with 
ansible.

Playbooks are Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. 
They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of 
steps in a general IT process. ansible playbook have 2 basic component, first is 
hosts and users setup, you can be spesify spesific node or just call group name 
that has been configured in inventory file. Second is tasks list, task would be 
executed in order, one at time, agains all machine matched by the host pattern, 
before moving on to the next task. tasks contains 
[collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html),
and [modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/modules/list_of_all_modules.html).

before we run the playbook file, we can check playbook no have file, roles, or 
syntax problem. run with the `--syntax-check` flag.

```bash
(ansible)$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check docker.yml
```

if no errors found we can run ansible playbook with following command, add `-i`
for inventory path, by default ansible read `/etc/ansible/hosts`

```bash
(ansible)$ ansible-playbook -i path docker.yml
```
